## Recommendations

* **VERY LOW IMPORTANCE** Add a function that will report back the length of the `approvedStakingContracts` array. So callers can iterate over 0..length, instead of 0..9 and detect an invalid address. I would not change the smart contracts just for this.

## Notes

### Admin Keys

Account `migrationManager` can execute:

* `setMigrationManager(...)`
* `setStakeChangeNotifier(...)`
* `addMigrationDestination(...)`
* `removeMigrationDestination(...)`

Account `emergencyManager` can execute:

* `setEmergencyManager(...)`
* `stopAcceptingNewStakes(...)`
* `releaseAllStakes()`

<br />

### States

`acceptingNewStakes`

`releasingAllStakes`

### Check

* `totalStakedTokens` - should not include unstaked tokens in cooldown period or pending withdrawal
* Check that can unstake and withdraw tokens if not `acceptingNewStakes`
* [x] If `releaseAllStakes()` is called before `stopAcceptingNewStakes()`, `stopAcceptingNewStakes()` cannot be executed. But this does not affect the result of the modifier `onlyWhenAcceptingNewStakes()` as both variables are checked in `require(acceptingNewStakes && !releasingAllStakes, ...)`
